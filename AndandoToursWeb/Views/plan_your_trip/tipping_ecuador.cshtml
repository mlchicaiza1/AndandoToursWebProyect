                Tipping in Ecuador is a monetary recognition that, although it is true that it is not 
                mandatory, is a sign of appreciation and appreciation for a good service.
            </p>
            <p>
                The amount of the tip in Ecuador that is attributed to each service provider and really 
                depends on many factors. Here you will find suggestions on how much, to whom and when 
                to attribute an additional reward known as a tip.

            <p><h2 style="color:black; text-align:left"> <b>When to consider leaving a tip in Ecuador</b></h2></p>
            <p>
                In each region of the country you will find helpful people who will make your stay more 
                pleasant. But when and how much should you consider leaving as a tip?
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li type="disc" style="margin-left:16px">
                        <span>
                            When you are <b>in a restaurant</b> and the waiter's attention has left you satisfied.
                        </span>
                    </li>
                    <li type="disc" style="margin-left:16px; margin-top:10px">
                        <span>
                            When the <b>hotel service personnel</b> took good care of you during your stay.
                        </span>
                    </li>
                    <li type="disc" style="margin-left:16px; margin-top:10px">
                        <span>
                            When a <b>tour guide</b> provides good service while accompanying you on a tour.
                        </span>
                    </li>
                    <li type="disc" style="margin-left:16px; margin-top:10px">
                        <span>
                            <b>When you request a wheelchair</b> or cart to get around airports.
                        </span>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                First and second category hotels, bars, and restaurants usually charge the additional <b>10% </b>
                to the customer to tip workers. You will be able to see that on your bill.
            </p>
            <p>
                In any case, if you would like to acknowledge the effort of the person who attended you personally, 
                you could add an additional voluntary tip other than the 10% you pay for service, which is normally 
                an additional 5%.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the establishment does not automatically include services, you could consider leaving an amount 
                of around 10% for the tip.
            </p>
            <p>
                Similarly, the average that is usually paid to guides is <b>10% of the cost of the tour.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember that paying a tip is completely voluntary, but it is a symbol of recognition and gratitude 
                for the good service received.
