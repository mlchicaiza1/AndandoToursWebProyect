                Tipping is always expected by hospitality, gastronomy and tourism industry workers.
                Tips are never an obligation but are given as a reward to the guide and crew for good
                service. If someone provides you with exceptional service, then it would be appropriate
                to tip well.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can discuss how much tip to give with other passengers who accompany you on the tour.
                Many groups end up collecting the tip so that it can then be divided between the guide
                and the crew.
            </p>
            <p><h2 style="color:black; text-align:left"> <b>Tipping for Galapagos Cruises</b></h2></p>
            <p>
                On cruises, it is customary to tip the crew and guide at the end of the trip. Some tour
                operators recommend 50% to the guide and 50% to distribute among the crew members. How
                much to tip is a personal decision, but here are some general guidelines:
            </p>
            <p>
                For less expensive or mid-range cruises, it is common to leave between <b>$14 and $20</b> per
                passenger per day. On the other hand, on high-end or luxury cruises, <b>$18 to $25</b> per
                passenger per day is standard.
            </p>
            <p>
                The total amount per passenger per day must be divided between guide and crew.
            </p>

            <p>
                As mentioned before, tips are always expected in the hotel industry. Galapagos is no exception. 
                The hotel bellboys and drivers expect tips. The appropriate amount for a bellboy would be one 
                or two dollars.
            </p>
            <p>
                Drivers always expect something especially after a long journey. Rounding up fares is recommended 
                to give a reasonable tip.
            </p>
            <p>
                The hotel maintenance staff expects one or two dollars a day for cleaning, especially in four or 
                five-star hotels.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tour guides usually receive <b>between $15-30 per day.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, it is not mandatory but it is always good to leave a tip if you are satisfied with the service.
